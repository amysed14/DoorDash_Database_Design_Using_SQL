# DoorDash_Database_Design_Using_SQL

In this project, I constructed a logical data model for DoorDash POS within a MySQL database framework. By organizing various processes into distinct entities such as transactions, employee details, and customer data, I streamlined the structure for enhanced analysis and optimization. Leveraging SQL queries, I fine-tuned the model to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in data management.
