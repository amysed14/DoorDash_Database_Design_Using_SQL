# DoorDash_Database_Design_Using_SQL

In this collaborative project, we constructed a logical data model for DoorDash POS within a MySQL database framework. By organizing various processes into distinct entities such as transactions, employee details, and customer data, I streamlined the structure for enhanced analysis and optimization. Leveraging SQL queries, we analyzed the data, identifying areas where optimization was needed to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in data management and to extract managerial insights.
